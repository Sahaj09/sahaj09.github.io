I am a Ph.D. student in the computer science department at Indiana University. I am broadly interested in cognitive mechanisms that enable intelligent systems to develop general-purpose capabilities.

Outside work, I like to bike with friends, find new coffee shops to work at, and dream of building generalist models that are better understood by us.
