I am a Ph.D. student in the computer science department at Indiana University. I am broadly interested in cognitively-inspired artificial intelligence and the computational properties of memory.

Outside work, I like to bike with friends, find new coffee shops to work at, and dream of building models that can defend themselves from the second reviewer without human intervention.
